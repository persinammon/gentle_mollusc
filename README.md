# My Personal Site

This is my personal site. I like it a lot, but it's not very sophisticated in terms of relevancy to industry-standard work.
It's for fun more than anything. Hence, it is named after the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals.

## Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Jekyll static site generator
- atrament.js painting pad library

## Functionalities

- About Me page with randomized quotes and image from hardcoded values, a separate noscript tag for visitors 
who don't have JavaScript enabled (sometimes visiting news websites without JavaScript enabled allows the user to 
bypass the paywall)
- Draggable elements as hidden surprise throughout  
- Pictures from trip to Taiwan with lazy loading set to load as soon as image element is in active view,
otherwise a default picture set before load
- A painting pad and crowd-sourced color palettes representing people's hometowns, allowing visitors to
paint with colors from people's hometowns, download the painting, and submit it for randomized display to future visitors.
Color palettes rendering and paint color logic implemented with vanilla JavaScript. Some submissions
deviated from the prompt a bit
